This is the Github Page for the R code and tools used in scientific research on American Community Survey Margins of Error.
This research was performed to investigate spatial patternings of margins of error on the ACS, and more closely analyze the changes to the ACS' reliability since 2020. 

The code and tools are published to improve replicability of the research, and to provide convenient error measurement benchmarks for other ACS data users.


The code was written by Alex Broening and Dr. Kyle Redican, in a team led by Dr. Kyle Redican. The full team consists of Dr. Kyle Redican, Alex Broening, Maddy King, and John Abbott.
